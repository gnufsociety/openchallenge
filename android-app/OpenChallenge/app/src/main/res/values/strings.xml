    <string name="rules">
        Rule Nombre Uno: never let no one know
        How much dough you hold cause you know
        The cheddar breed jealousy \'specially
        If that man fucked up, get yo\' ass stuck up
        \n\n
        Number 2: never let \'em know your next move
        Don\'t you know Bad Boys move in silence and violence?
        Take it from your highness I done squeezed mad
        clips at these cats for they bricks and chips
        \n\n
        Number 3: never trust nobody
        Your moms\'ll set that ass up, properly gassed up
        Hoodied and masked up, shit, for that fast buck
        She be laying in the bushes to light that ass up
        \n\n
        Number 4: I know you heard this before
        Never get high on your own supply
        \n\n
        Number 5: never sell no crack where you rest at
        I don\'t care if they want a ounce, tell \'em \'bounce!\'
        \n\n
        Number 6: that goddamn credit? Dead it
        You think a crackhead paying you back, shit forget it!
        \n\n
        7: this rule is so underrated
        Keep your family and business completely separated
        Money and blood don\'t mix like two dicks and no bitch
        Find yourself in serious shit
        \n\n
        Number 8: never keep no weight on you!
        Them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jums too
        \n\n
        Number 9 shoulda been Number 1 to me:
        If you ain\'t gettin\' bagged stay the fuck from police
        If niggas think you snitchin\' they ain\'t trying to listen
        They be sittin\' in your kitchen, waiting to start hittin\'
        \n\n
        Number 10: a strong word called \'consignment\'
        Strictly for live men, not for freshmen
        If you ain\'t got the clientele, say \'hell no!\'</string>
