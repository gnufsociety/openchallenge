# OpenChallenge 
##->[Website](https://gnufsociety.github.io/index.html)<-

OpenChallenge is a new app that allows you to challenge your friends in anything that comes to your mind.

The focus is on people meeting in a place to take part in challenges: here people are not passive and can put themselves to the test or just have fun with close friends.

**Pubs** are an important part of the atmosphere and are especially encouraged to organize challenges in order to increase the number of clients of their activities!
