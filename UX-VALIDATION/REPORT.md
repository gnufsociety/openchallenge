# User experience validation report

We asked a few users (note that a [study](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/) 
showed that is unuseful to test with lots of users) what did they think about our user interface, how did they feel it etc.

Here are some of the questions we made:

- How would you organize a challenge?
- What do you expect by clicking the icons in the bottom bar?
- How would you save a challenge?
- How would you look for a challenge?
- How would you see who participates in a challenge?
- How wold you join a challenge?
- How do you fell watching the interface?

Here are some of the hand-sketched images we showed:
